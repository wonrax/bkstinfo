### ðŸ”” Call for repo maintainer
I've graduated from our school, so I might not be able to access the system in the near future. New features may need active class schedules to test too. If you're interested, open an issue (or contact me, link in bio) and I'll consider to make you a repo maintainer. I can still help with product design and code.
